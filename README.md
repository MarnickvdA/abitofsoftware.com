# Blog
Website powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating blog posts
The purpose of this website is to act as a static website containing blog articles I write in the common time. 
New blogs can be added simply by creating a new `.md` blog file in the `/src/posts` directory.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```
